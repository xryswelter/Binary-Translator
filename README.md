# Binary-Translator
This is a basic website to translate basic roman letters and basic special characters into binary.  Currently only one direction, no binary to chracters just yet.

## How to use
Enter in the word or phrase you wish into the input field and hit the button.  Depending on how long the sentence is the code will appear.  Each gray block is a word.
